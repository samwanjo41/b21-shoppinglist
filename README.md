This repo contains a partially functioning version of the shoppinglist web app. The repo contains HTML/CSS files for the user landing page and, the user dashboard and the signup and login pages.The html/css files are only interfaces; their functionalities have not been implemented yet.

Motivation
=====================
The idea behind this project is that users will need an application that will enable them to keep track of their shopping items allowing them to remember and share them with others

Styling
=====================
Most of the style work in the app was done using bootstrap, a css framework. The bootstrap framework specifies 'components', higher level UI components composed of more basic HTML tags.
